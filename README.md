# Calories Burnt Prediction


This project predicts the calories burnt during physical activity using user-specific data such as age, gender, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature. It employs machine learning models like XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree for accurate predictions, with a Flask-based web interface for real-time inputs and results.




## Features

1. Predicts calories burnt based on user data.
2. Multiple machine learning models trained and evaluated.
3. Web interface using Flask for user interaction.
4. Data visualization for analysis and insights.
